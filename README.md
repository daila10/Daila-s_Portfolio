## Academic Projects

### [Computational Intelligence for Optimization](https://github.com/daila10/CIFO_Group21/tree/main)
This project aimed to solve the Stigler's Diet Problem with implementation of a genetic algorithm. The algorithm is designed to find optimal solutions that meet specific nutritional requirements while minimizing the cost of food items. This project achieved a grade of 19.8 out of 20. <br />

### [Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/daila10/Projects/tree/University/Data%20Mining%20Project)
Using clustering techniques to segment the market, this project aimed to identify customer groups based on geographic, demographic, psychographic, and behavioral characteristics. This allowed to make strategic choices for better serving existing customers and improving the targeting of prospective customers. This project achieved a grade of 19 out of 20. <br />

### [Machine Learning](https://github.com/daila10/Projects/tree/University/Machine%20Learning%20Project)
The purpose of this project is to solve “The Smith Parasite” Kaggle case using Machine Learning knowledge. This case regards a new disease that already spread to over 5000 people and the investigator group aims to determine who is more prone to catch the disease, so that people are more aware of the disease’s symptoms and consequences. This project achieved a grade of 18.5 out of 20. <br />

### [Particle Swarm Optimiation & Genetic Algorithm](https://github.com/daila10/Projects/tree/University/Computational%20Methods%20for%20Optimisation)
In this project, I programmed from scratch Particle Swarm Algorithm and I manipulated a provided Genetic Algorithm code to include geometric operators and elitism. The grade obtained was 19.5 out of 20. <br />

### [Machine Learning Operations](https://github.com/daila10/MLOps_project)
The aim of this project was to develop a machine learning model for predicting machine failure and deploying it into production environment. This project achieved a grade of 16.5 out of 20. <br />
