## Academic Projects

### [Master Thesis - Fraud Detection Systems Empowered by Context-Awareness](https://github.com/daila10/Projects/tree/University/Fraud%20Detection%20Systems%20Empowered%20by%20Context-Awareness)
Unsing real-world data, this project proposes the optimization of a fraud detection system by making it dynamic with the use of machine learning and reinforcement learning techniques. <br />
- Programming language: Python <br />
- Final grade: 20/20 <br />

### [Computational Intelligence for Optimization](https://github.com/daila10/CIFO_Group21/tree/main)
This project aimed to solve the Stigler's Diet Problem with implementation of a genetic algorithm. The algorithm is designed to find optimal solutions that meet specific nutritional requirements while minimizing the cost of food items. <br />
- Programming language: Python <br />
- Final grade: 19.8/20 <br />

### [Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/daila10/Projects/tree/University/Data%20Mining%20Project)
Using clustering techniques to segment the market, this project aimed to identify customer groups based on geographic, demographic, psychographic, and behavioral characteristics. This allowed to make strategic choices for better serving existing customers and improving the targeting of prospective customers.<br />
- Programming language: Python <br />
- Final grade: 19/20 <br />

### [Machine Learning](https://github.com/daila10/Projects/tree/University/Machine%20Learning%20Project)
The purpose of this project is to solve “The Smith Parasite” Kaggle case using Machine Learning knowledge. This case regards a new disease that already spread to over 5000 people and the investigator group aims to determine who is more prone to catch the disease, so that people are more aware of the disease’s symptoms and consequences.<br />
- Programming language: Python <br />
- Final grade: 18.5/20 <br />

### [Particle Swarm Optimization & Genetic Algorithm](https://github.com/daila10/Projects/tree/University/Computational%20Methods%20for%20Optimisation)
In this project, I programmed from scratch Particle Swarm Algorithm and I manipulated a provided Genetic Algorithm code to include geometric operators and elitism.<br />
- Programming language: Python <br />
- Final grade: 19.5/20 <br />

### [Machine Learning Operations](https://github.com/daila10/MLOps_project)
The aim of this project was to develop a Machine Learning model for predicting machine failure and deploying it into production environment using Kedro, a pipeline framework with the integration of MLflow tracking and management of multiple model iterations and combinations. <br />
- Programming language: Python <br />
- Final grade: 16.5/20 <br />

### [Text Mining](https://github.com/daila10/Projects/tree/University/Text%20Mining)
This project focuses on the analysis and prediction of property listings on Airbnb, using Text Mining and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The objective is to explore and preprocess the text data, followed by training several models to predict the unlisted status of properties in the test dataset. <br />
- Programming language: Python <br />
- Final grade: 14/20 <br />
