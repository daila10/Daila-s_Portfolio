## Projects

### [Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/daila10/Projects/tree/University/Data%20Mining%20Project)
This was an academic project made with two other colleagues whose credit is at the end of the description. Using clustering techniques to segment the market, we aimed to identify customer groups based on geographic, demographic, psychographic, and behavioral characteristics. This allowed us to make strategic choices for better serving existing customers and improving the targeting of prospective customers. In this project we achieved a grade of 19 out of 20. <br />

### [Particle Swarm Optimisation & Genetic Algorithm](https://github.com/daila10/Projects/tree/University/Computational%20Methods%20for%20Optimisation)
Also in the academic scope, in this project I programmed from scratch Particle Swarm Algorithm and I manipulated a provided Genetic Algorithm code to include geometric operators and elitism. The grade obtained was 19.50 out of 20.
